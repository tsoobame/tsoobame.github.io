<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">A common mantra in our industry is <code>&quot;Use the right tool for the job&quot;</code>.  This idea gained momentum with the microservices hype, leading to a surge in polyglot programming, persistence, and more. This diversification has seen companies adopting a myriad of programming languages, persistence layers, frameworks, and tools in pursuit of the perfect solution, often overlooking the adequacy of existing tools within their stack.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">A few years ago, I also fell into the trap of microservices and technology proliferation. Fortunately, the small size of our team and our codebase made the damage reversible and manageable.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">This experience made me pause and take time for introspection. Was I genuinely choosing the right tools for the project or was I unconsciously choosing shiny tools that would make my resume more interesting?
Despite my best intentions, I couldn&#x27;t completely disregard the personal desire for learning about them.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">This realization led me to adopt a more judicious and methodical approach to integrating new technologies into our projects</p>
<style data-emotion="css gtvj52">.css-gtvj52{margin:0;font-family:"Roboto","Helvetica","Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:400;font-size:2.125rem;line-height:1.235;letter-spacing:0.00735em;margin-bottom:0.35em;}</style><h4 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-gtvj52" style="margin-top:24px">Adding a new tech to the stack</h4>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Introducing new technology—be it a language, framework, persistence layer, message broker, etc.—requires a learning curve. We love exploring new tools and the novelty of solving use cases and enabling features, needed or not. We tend to underestimate the learning curve of understanding how they fail, when they tend to fail, how the errors are discovered or monitored, and designing how to recover from those errors.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">The real test often comes after deployment, challenging us to reassess the need for that new technology after we&#x27;ve already introduced it.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Thus, I urge you to think twice before expanding your tech stack.</p>
<h4 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-gtvj52" style="margin-top:24px">Chosing technology</h4>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">During the introspection period I stumbled into thought-provoking piece titled <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Chose boring technology</a>, which eloquently argued against the rush to adopt new technologies and embrace the boring ones, understanding <code>boring</code> as the ones we know and understand well and, therefore, don&#x27;t give any surprises.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">If your project already has an established tech stack, here are some considerations before introducing new technology:</p>
<h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-t1nuxs" style="margin-top:24px">Can the existing tech stack address the problem?</h5>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Design the solution with the current stack, without adding any new technology. If the design is feasible, it can be the baseline for the decision.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Some challenges for the design:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:3px">Would it be compliant with the non-functional requirements or SLAs?</p></li>
<li><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:3px">How complex or maintailable is the implementation?</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-t1nuxs" style="margin-top:24px">Future project features</h5>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Assess whether the planned features or project direction could benefit from introducing the tech stack.
For example some technologies can act as enablers for future features.</p>
<h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-t1nuxs" style="margin-top:24px">Team expertise</h5>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Consider the team&#x27;s familiarity with the new technology and the implications of acquiring or hiring expertise.</p>
<h4 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-gtvj52" style="margin-top:24px">Real-World naive Example</h4>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Let&#x27;s consider a hypothetical project with the following tech stack:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:3px">React in front end</p></li>
<li><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:3px">Nodejs in the backend (with Express)</p></li>
<li><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:3px">Postgres as the main database</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Your data is structured and fits well in a relational database. Your application is mostly a CRUD application.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Life is good, and things are working as expected until a couple of new features appear in the backlog.</p>
<h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-t1nuxs" style="margin-top:24px">Feature 1: Integrating unstructured data</h5>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">You have a new feature that—for some reason—requires storing unstructured data. When investigating tools, you find Document DBs, one of them being MongoDB.</p>

After some research, you learn that Postgres supports JSON or JSONB column types that can store unstructured data. Your design includes a JSONB column in the table, and you can query it as you would with a document database.</p>
<h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-4an0mh" style="margin-top:24px">Future project features</h6>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">After scanning through the product backlog, nothing calls your attention that could break your design.</p>
<h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-4an0mh" style="margin-top:24px">Team expertise</h6>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">The team has a lot of experience with Postgres and a couple of team members are certified in MongoDB.</p>
<h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-4an0mh" style="margin-top:24px">Decision</h6>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Keeping the tech stack and using Postgres&#x27; JSONB column type seems the sensible approach.</p>
<h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-t1nuxs" style="margin-top:24px">Feature 2: Real-time* notifications</h5>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">The team is to work on a new feature that requires real-time* notifications. Some actions need to be notified to the affected users.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">When investigating about events, real-time notifications, you find out about message brokers like NATS Server, RabbitMQ, or Kafka. You consider adding them to the tech stack. But—of course—you think twice and follow your process to make the right decision.</p>
<h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-4an0mh" style="margin-top:24px">Can the existing tech stack address the problem?</h6>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">After some research, you find out that PostgreSQL has LISTEN/NOTIFY that supports the Pub/Sub pattern and could be used to subscribe to changes and produce the right notifications. You also read about the outpost pattern that could be used for the feature at hand.</p>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">You create two designs, one using LISTEN/NOTIFY and the other using the outpost pattern.</p>

<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">This approach could work and your design seems correct.
One of the drawbacks is the performance of the database. The more subscribers, the more load on the database. That might impact your queries and the performance of the website.</p>
<span class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h7 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-mxjm1x" style="margin-top:24px">Outpost pattern</span>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Agains, this approach could work and seems elegant and simple.
One of the drawbacks is that you would need to add a new table for each subscription type (push notifications, emails, etc).
For the feature at hand you only need one subscription but that limitation is something to consider.</p>
<h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-4an0mh" style="margin-top:24px">What other features are down the line?</h6>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">Scanning through the backlog you find multiple stories related to notifications, real-time updates, etc.
Your choice will need to consider that shift towards real-time event-driven features.</p>
<h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-4an0mh" style="margin-top:24px">How much expertise about that tool do we have in the team?</h6>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">The team has a lot of experience with Postgres but not using LISTEN/NOTIFY.
Some of the team members know well RabbitMQ and/or Kafka.</p>
<h6 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom css-4an0mh" style="margin-top:24px">Decision</h6>
<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">You decide that using Postgres alone is not suitable for these features and the ones to come. Adding a message broker is needed and will enable more features in the future.

<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-wje1bd" style="text-align:justify">After some more research, your team decides to go with RabbitMQ.</p>
