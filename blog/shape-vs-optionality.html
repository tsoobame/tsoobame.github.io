    <h1 id="decomplecting-shape-and-optionality">Decomplecting shape and optionality</h1>
<h2 id="tldr">TLDR;</h2>
<p>Defining a schema for a given entity we tend to define what attributes this entity has, what types or invariants<br />
each of those attributes have and what attributes are required or optional.</p>
<p>In this post I am exposing that the shape of the data (attributes and their types) need to be discussed separately<br />
from their optionality. The optionality does not belong to the entity but to the operation being executed.<br />
If we discuss and define both concepts together as part of the Entity we are complecting two concepts that should we separate<br />
them, the simplicity, clarity and reusability of our system will be greatly improved.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Apart from my own experience some of the concepts described in this post are also described by well-known<br />
engineers like Rich Hickey in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug">Maybe Not</a> available in my <a href="/recommended-resources">recommended resources</a></p>
<p>I will use a Blog Post as the example for the model but the concepts in this post can be applied to any entity and discussion we can think of.</p>
<h2 id="defining-a-blog-post">Defining a blog Post</h2>
<h3 id="defining-the-shape">Defining the shape</h3>
<p>We need to define the data model of a Post that will be used in a blog (any blog).<br />
After some meetings we agree that we need the following fields:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;"><code><span style="display:flex;"><span>- ID: uuid that will identiy the post uniquely
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>- Title: short text to be shown in links and use as slug
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>- Body: text where the post will be written to
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>- Tags: list of keywords to find similar posts
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>- PublishedAt: datetime when the post was published
</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="defining-the-optionality">Defining the optionality</h3>
<p>Once we agree on the shape of the Post entity, we start a new discussion:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What fields are required and what are optional?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It seems like all are required since we would need to show all of them in the blog. So we move on<br />
and decide that we will make all columns NOT NULL in the DB.</p>
<p>After some time discussing, a junior developer asks:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What about drafts?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Another discussion starts about &quot;What is a draft?&quot;. Should a draft have the same shape as the Post but with &quot;nullable&quot;<br />
fields? what are the required fields in this case?</p>
<p>After some time discussing the team decided to have 2 very similar tables one with drafts where columns (except id) are NULLABLE and<br />
posts where all columns are required.</p>
<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
<p>There are two entities that somehow are too closely related.<br />
This lead to some problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>⛔ Entity proliferation. We have all been in projects with too many entities that seem to describe almost the same thing.</li>
<li>⛔ Change management: New fields in Posts will require new fields in Drafts almost always.</li>
<li>⛔ Event ambiguity: If we use EDA or similar, are Drafts / Posts events sent to the same topic? are they really different?<br />
how can we see the history of a Post if it starts as a Draft?</li>
<li>✅ DB leverage: we can use DB schemas to control whether the data being stored is correct or not.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rolling-back">Rolling back</h2>
<p>Defining the shape of the entity is something we cannot avoid (or if we can we should not). Having<br />
a clear description of what an Entity is, and what parts form it is desirable specially if the names<br />
and types of the fields are defined by the Domain experts.</p>
<p>The problem started when we discussed about the optionality of the fields. When we started discussion:</p>
<p>What fields are required and what are optional?</p>
<p>The answer to this question should have been another question:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br />
(as engineers we should ask <code>when</code> more often than we do)</p>
<h3 id="optionality-per-operation">Optionality per operation</h3>
<p>What are the operations we can do for/on Posts?<br />
Let's say that we can do 3 operations with Posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the post</li>
<li>Publish the post</li>
<li>Unpublish the post</li>
<li>Delete the post</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We cannot edit a post if it is published</li>
<li>We cannot delete a post if it is published</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionality has to do with the operation we want to perform on/with a given Envity.<br />
For example, asking:</p>
<p>What are the required fields when publishing a post?</p>
<p>The conclusion would be very similar to the <a href="#defining-the-optionality">previous discusion</a>.</p>
<p>But if we discussed about what are the required field when saving a Post then the answer will be something around: None.</p>
<p>We can let users save the posts in whatever state they are (missing tags, missing body, etc)</p>
<h3 id="consequences-1">Consequences</h3>
<p>There is only one entity that goes through different states until it is published.<br />
The benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Entity proliferation: so far under control.</li>
<li>✅ Change management: there is only one entity we need to think about.</li>
<li>✅ Event unambiguity: all events belong to the same entity so we have one topic and one history line.</li>
<li>⛔ DB leverage: DB Schema cannot be leveraged to control required fields/columns. The control is in the application layer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<p>If we changed the rules and we allowed to edit a post while it is published when discussing the optionality during the <code>save</code> operation<br />
we would need to ask <code>When</code> again.<br />
When the post is already published the requirements will be different than when the post is not published yet (or was unpublished).</p>
